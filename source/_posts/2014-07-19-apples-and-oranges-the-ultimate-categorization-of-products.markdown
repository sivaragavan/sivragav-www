We all know that we shouldn’t compare Apples (anything) to Oranges (any other thing that is fundamentally different). But we do it all the time. There are thousands of posts/videos that compare iPhone to Android phones, Twitter to Facebook, Dropbox to Google Drive and so on. What do we understand from these comparisons ?

We have developed tastes and preferences in products over time. Some prefer simple ones. Some prefer good looking ones. Some prefer Quantity. Some prefer Quality. Some prefer cheaper ones. Some prefer premium ones. But in most of the cases, these qualities are not very evident when we look at a product for the first time. As we start using it, we feel this doesn’t taste right. This is mostly because we are expecting an Apple to taste like an Orange or the reverse. This results in the dreaded comparison of Apples to Oranges.

### The ultimate categorization

Let’s try to categorize our tastes into two broad groups, say Apples and Oranges.
I understand. There can be a million different tastes that people might have. How can we fit all of them into just two groups ? But for simplifying the problem, lets assume that there are just two fruits, which are fundamentally different. This will certainly help in reducing our options to half, when making a decision. We will clearly know what to expect, when we by an Apple or an Orange.

### The Apples

These are the products that are simple to consume and ready to use out of the box. No slicing/dicing of features, they are useful as a whole. You buy it and use it. They might not have all the features that are provided by their competitors. But they just work without much effort. The name of this category is inspired by both the “Apple fruit” and the “Apple Inc.” iPhone, Medium, Twitter are some examples of Apples.

### The Oranges

These are the products that are feature rich and highly customisable. To get the real benefit of these products, you will have to peel through the top layer and make use of the different features provided. They might optionally contain a cheaper price tag. They usually have a bigger user base than Apples. The name of this category is inspired by the “Orange Fruit” and its juicy complexity hidden inside. Facebook, Windows, Android, Wordpress are examples of Oranges.

### Co-existence

Hope you got an idea. I am not trying to write down a rule book here (might be a good topic for another post). It is a generic guideline, which will keep evolving as we start categorizing. In the beginning, It might be slightly different for everyone. But I am sure that slowly we will converge into common understanding. Remember this is not about categorizing companies. Each company might sell their own Apples and Oranges.

Both these categories of products are absolutely needed for their unique benefits, just like how we consume both the fruits in all seasons. The oranges are results of new inventions that might be complex in nature to use. The apples are results of simplification of the features that add most value. In some areas you might be happy to try out new features at the cost of complexity. In other areas you might just want to stick to the simplest solution.

I hope this will help in making a decision with your next product hunt/search. Be aware of what you are buying. Is it an Apple or an Orange ? That way you will be clear what to expect from these products.

Have fun categorizing any product you come across.

Help others by letting them know your views. If you found an Apple, tweet/post/blog with hashtag “[\#AppleInAorO][1]”. Similarly for an Orange “[\#OrangeInAorO][2]”.
