The cloud as we know today powers a lot of activities that we do everyday. Cloud lets us get connected to the rest of the world. It looks like a perfect system.

What could be wrong now ? You guessed it right. Our Data in the Cloud.

Let's take a look at our data across the cloud from the below perspectives :

### Security
Is our data secure in the cloud ? Not completely. Whatever be the technology that is used to secure our data, it is still vulnerable. All your data is available for any powerful organization to track you. It is also available to different organizations to suggest you a purchase or control your behavior in many different ways. It will never be more secure in the cloud than it being with you and the people who really need it.

### Convenience
We use a variety of cloud services everyday, that improves our quality of life. But there are also services that we use just for convenience. For instance, We want all our content in all our devices. Just to sync our stuff between our devices, we give away our stuff to someone else and get it back from them when we need it.

### Single point of failure
If GMail is down, imagine how many of us are affected. Even though Cloud is not just a single point physically, It is a single point from our usage perspective and IT CAN FAIL. In most of our cases, we donâ€™t have our data anywhere else other than cloud. No matter how much the cloud companies try to keep us connected to the system, we will still have down times.

### Sustainability
Will this system (cloud) survive the next decade ? Yes. The decade after that ? I doubt it. A small percentage of the devices in the world (Cloud) are handling the requests from the rest of the devices in the world. At the rate at which new devices are born and getting connected to the cloud, Cloud cannot infintely expand to handle all these devices.

### Network
We are exploiting our networks to stay in cloud. Even though the same information is available closer to you in another device, we go to the cloud to fetch it.

### The residue
There is so much residue left behind when we use cloud. We sign up for different services and completely forget it. It stays there for a really long time. Who is going to clean it all ? We don't have any way to wipe clean the data we don't need anymore.

### Singularity
Cloud might eventually lead to Singularity. After several decades, we will just be renting everything from the cloud. The Cloud will be more powerful than us. We will be heavily depending on in it for our basic needs. Slowly we will loose all the controls and let the system guide us. Every service out there wants to own you and your data. They make their services so easy to use that we forget that we are loosing control.

### Conclusion
There is no one solution to all these problems. Everybody has to carry their own weight. User-generated data should be owned by users themselves. P2P (Peer-to-Peer) looks like a promising solution. More about P2P in another post.

Cloud is still a good option for organizations to distribute their content and do their businesses.
But probably not a good fit for user generated content.
