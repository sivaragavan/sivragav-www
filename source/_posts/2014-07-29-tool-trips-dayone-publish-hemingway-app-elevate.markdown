**[Day One Publish][1]** - [@dayone][2]

**Day One** helps in collecting every thought that comes to my mind. It has got a clean and simple interface that keeps me focused on journaling and nothing else. Recently Day One has extended this experience for publishing too. **Day One Publish** is a simple and clean way to post thoughts or experiences online. It creates a fresh page for each item you publish and lets you share the link to different social networks. Publishing through Day One feels a bit more natural than writing and sharing a blog post. Here is a sample : https://dayone.me/x8hzm8

**[Hemingway App][3]** - [@HemingwayApp][4]

Hemingway App grades written articles on a scale of 10 in readability. It also suggests improvements across 4 different measures. It can detect long complex statements, unecessary adverbs and words or phrases that can be simpler. It can also detect excessive use of passive voice. Though it canâ€™t replace your primary writing tool yet, It works well as a validation tool before posting your article.

**[Elevate][5]** - [@elevatelabs][6]

This personal brain trainer never stops to amaze me. I stumbled upon it a week back and now I am using it regularly. It trains the mind to improve writing, reading, listening and speaking. The way it has gamified the whole experience separates this app from the rest of the mediocre ones. I will cover more about elevate in another article.
