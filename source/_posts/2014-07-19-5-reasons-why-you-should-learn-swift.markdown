### New Opportunities
Apple is making Swift their mainstream language to build iPhone and Mac Apps. Every company that is using the latest Apple technologies is going to look for Swift Developers and there are none at this point. There is no better opportunity than this. Nothing is better than getting a head start in a new technology. How many times have you really had an advantage of being an expert of a main stream language before others in the market. You always knew some one who has more experience than you and more qualified for a job. Now is the time to learn something new and be the forerunner.

### Functional Programming
Swift is built on functional programming paradigms just like Scala, Ruby, Erlang, R, Python, Java Script and list goes on. These langauges have gained a lot of popularity in the recent years than langauges like Java, C, C++, Perl and PHP. The functional programming languages have clearly become more dominant in the developer community. The good news is that if you have experienced functional programming paradigms before, It is relatively easy to learn Swift. If you are new to these concepts, why not start with Swift.

### Have Fun
Playground is a new interactive feature released in XCode that helps you test small code snippets before putting them in your codebase. It makes writing Swift code incredibly simple and fun. Type a line of code and the result appears immediately along with a lot of profiling information. If your code runs over time, for instance through a loop, you can watch its progress in the timeline assistant. The timeline can display a variableâ€™s value over time or even a animation in the UI. Once you have perfected your code, it can go into your project. This is great tool to desing new algorithms and watch it progress step by step. It is also very helpful when testing out a new API or any third-party library.

### Experience Apple
Swift is built with the same principles that is used to build other Apple Products like iPhone, iPad and MacBook. It is expressive, simple and powerful at the same time. Closures, Optionals and Inferred Types are some examples that showcase these principles. It is fast, smooth and designed with safety from the foundation. It eliminates entire classes of unsafe code and makes it really tough to make mistakes. It is really a pleasure to code in Swift. Try it.

### Feel Young
Learning is Fun. It awakens your inner senses and makes you feel younger. Most of us might be programming in the same languages for years. We have our own scripts in head, which we execute when we hit with a problem or do a Google search. Overcome your scripts, patterns, best practices and start defining new ones for you and the community.
