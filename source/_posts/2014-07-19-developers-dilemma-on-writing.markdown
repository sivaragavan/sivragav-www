This article is my attempt to write something after a long break. I deleted my old blog with all the posts in it, since I never wrote anything in years. I have been busy building software all these years. I like creating stuff. But when it comes to writing, I face a multitude of problems.

## Where should I host my blog ?
Most of my previous attempts at writing has been in wordpress. I spend my most of the time buying a domain name (at Godaddy), setting up the blog (mostly wordpress, recently Jekyll) and customising it (css, images, layout), even before I write my first article.

## What topic should I write about ?
I get torn between a variety of topics starting from reviews of development frameworks to personal productivity. When I sit down to write, it all goes blank. All kinds of questions popup : Will my readers like this topic at all ? Should I be writing about X instead of Y ? For a good writer, topic shouldn’t be a barrier.

## Is it perfect and well organized ?
Even before writing 10 lines, I start organising the content, moving them up and down, creating headings and adding images. It doesn’t just obstruct the flow for the writer, but also spoils the reader’s experience too. The best organisation for an article is probably the one that comes out of the draft. This helps readers to connect to the writer’s idea better.

## Let me start executing this idea
Writing is a very creative process. Lot of ideas flow out of my brain, when I start typing. My immediate reaction used to be to stop writing and start thinking about the idea and probably start designing/coding it right away.

Today, I wanted to give a shot at writing without any of these distractions. Here I am writing this article as plain text in [Workflowy](http://workflowy.com) and I have not yet figured out where I am going to host this.

Edit : I tried Medium. Didn't want to loose my traffic to them. Finally settled for Jekyll/Octopress on Digital Ocean. More on this in my next article.
