The cloud as we know today powers lot of the activities that we do everyday. Everybody is moving to the cloud to get connected. It looks like a perfect system.

What could be wrong with it ?

Let's take a look at the user-generated content across the cloud from the below perspectives :

<!--more-->

__Security :__
Is our data secure in the cloud ? No.
Whatever be the technology that is used to secure our data, it is still vulnerable.
All your data is available for any powerful organization to track you.
It is also available to any organization to suggest you a purchase or control your behavior in many different ways.

It will never be more secure in the cloud than it being with you and the people who really need it.

__Convenience :__
There are several cloud services we use everyday, that improves our quality of life.
But there are also services that we use just for convenience.
For instance, We want all our content in all our devices.
Just to sync our stuff between our devices, we give away our stuff to someone else and get it back from them when we need it.


__Single point of failure :__
If GMail is down, imagine how many of us are affected. Cloud is a single point of failure.
Not matter how much the cloud companies try to keep us connected to the system, we will still have down times.

__Sustainability :__
Will this system (cloud) survive the next decade ? Yes. The decade after that ? Probably no.
A small percentage of the devices in the world (Cloud) are handling the rest of the devices in the world.
At the rate at which new devices are born and getting connected to the cloud, Cloud cannot expand to handle all these devices.

__Network :__
We are exploiting our networks to stay in cloud.
Even though the same information is available closer to you in another device, we go to the machine farm to fetch it.

__The mess :__
There is so much residue left behind when we use cloud. We sign up for different services and completely forget it.
It stays there for a really long time. Who is going to clean it all ?
We don't have any way to wipe clean the data we don't need anymore.

__Singularity :__
Cloud will eventually lead to Singularity. After several decades, we will just be renting everything from the cloud.
The Cloud will be more powerful than us. We will be heavily depending on in it for our basic needs. Slowly we will loose all the controls and let the system guide us.
Every service out there wants to own you and your data. They make their services so easy to use that we forget that we are loosing control.

__Conclusion :__
There is no one solution to all these problems. Everybody has to carry their own weight. User-generated data should be owned by users themselves.
P2P (Peer-to-Peer) looks like the most promising one. More about Peer-To-Peer in next post.

Cloud is still a good option for organizations to distribute their content and do their businesses.
But probably not a good fit for user generated content.
